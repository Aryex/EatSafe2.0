# EatSafe2.0
Based off of my team project from school. Contains further improvements and new features that didn't make it into submission. 

What's new:
- Lcoation services refactored to a wrapper.

TODO:
- Re-wrote search class.
- Change filtering to use search widget.
- Re-write main menu to use slide-up panel.
- Device location focus will also re-orient device direction.
